## Logging, Scaling, and High Availability

- How do you access application logs?
> cf logs APP_NAME

- What are the components of the Loggregator system?

> 1. Loggregator/Metron Agent - Loggregator/Metron Agents run on both PCF component VMs and Diego cell VMs. They receive logs and metrics from the apps and PCF components located on those VMs and then forward the logs and metrics to Dopplers.
> 2. Doppler - gather logs from Loggregator Agent and store them in temporary buffer. Forwards logs to Traffic Controller.
> 3. Traffic Controller - handles client requests for logs
> 4. Firehose - a websocket endpoint that exposes app logs, container metrics and ER component metrics
> 5. Nozzles - consume the firehose output

- How do you scale an application manually?
> cf scale <APP_NAME> -m <Size> -i <Instance_COUNT>


- What are the four levels of high-availability provided by PCF?

> 1. BOSH detects and recreates failed VMs
> 2. BOSH also detects and restarts failed processes
> 3. Application instances are automatically spread
-- Across different Cells
-- Across Cells in different Availability Zones
> 4. CF Converger detects if an application instance has failed and restarts it

- What is the difference between scaling up and scaling out?
> - scale up (vertically) increases the disk space limit or memory limit of all instances of an application. It requires downtime as the container is recreated.
> - scale out (horizontally) increases the number of instances of an application by creating or destroying them. It requires no downtime.

### pluralsight recap



- What are some fundamental changes impacting application design and delivery?

>  - Distributed computing
>  - Ephemeral infrastructure
>  - Immutable infrastructure

- What is a modern methodology for delivering cloud based applications?

> Twelve-factor app

- How are logs handled in a Twelve-factor app?

> As event streams

- True or false, Garden is an interface with many implementations.

> True, there's Linux and Windows and more on the way

- Which component of the Elastic runtime exposes an API for users to manage applications?

> Cloud controller

- What are the four levels of high availability that keep your applications running?

>  - Availability zones
>  - BOSH managed processes
>  - Failed VMs - any VM that BOSH deploys will be recreated if you enable resurrector
>  - Self healing application instances handled by the brain within Diego

- Where should you write your application logs?

>  - To Standard Out and Standard Error

- What are some of the different origin codes that were seen in the log?

>  - cf logs
>  - API for cloud controller
>  - stage for stating 
>  - cell for running applications

- What did you think about accessing the logs? How is that different from what you do today?

- What is the difference between scaling out versus scaling up?

> Scaling up requires down time to recreate the container
> Scaling horizontally requires no downtime

- How do you recover failed application instances today? What happens if the underlying platform fails? How do you recover from that?

- How could you tell if your application has been crashing?

> Look at the logs, but probably the best place to go is cf events
